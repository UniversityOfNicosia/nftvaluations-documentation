On the browse page, you can click on any NFT to go to the NFT page. This way, you can reveal more information about any NFT. On the NFT page, there are enhanced insights about the NFT to discover.

On the left column, you can find:

- Properties of the NFT
- The account that currently holds the NFT
- The collection that the NFT is part of

In the properties section, you can find the properties that the NFT has and compare which of the available properties are rarer.

You can track the collection and follow the owner's account from this page. Click on Follow and select which wallet group you wish to add the account to. Don't forget to connect your wallet to activate this feature. In future updates, you will have the ability to track properties and receive customisable notifications to always stay in the game.

- NFTi and Adjusted Floor valuations as well as their history
- Buy now price (if any)
- Sale and Listing history
- Activities

The first data visualisation helps you make sense of the valuation history and compare [NFTi](https://docs.nftvaluations.com/documentation/methodology/#nfti-market-capitalization-nfti-market-cap) and [Adjusted Floor](https://docs.nftvaluations.com/documentation/methodology/#adjusted-floor-market-capitalization-af-market-cap) values at first glance.

On the buy now section underneath, you can see how far off/near the buy know price is to our NFTi value in percentage. This value is only available when the NFT is available for sale.

In the third section of the main body, you can see an additional data visualisation illustrating the sales history along with the following insights:

- Last sale
- Top sale
- Total sales
- Total owners
- Hold time

The final section of the main body shows all the activities. You can filter the activities by event type (sale, transfer and mint).
