## Welcome to NFT Valuations: Home Page

You can screen the market trends with in-depth analysis and valuation on the home page. Instantly make sense of complex market trends with curated data visualization. The first chart on the top left illustrates which collections stands out from the crowd taking into account our two valuation methods: [NFTi](https://docs.nftvaluations.com/documentation/methodology/#nfti-market-capitalization-nfti-market-cap) and [Adjusted Floor](https://docs.nftvaluations.com/documentation/methodology/#adjusted-floor-market-capitalization-af-market-cap). You change the ordering based on the valuation method from the drop-down menu on the top right.

The second chart helps you screen the total market cap valued by [Adjusted Floor](https://docs.nftvaluations.com/documentation/methodology/#adjusted-floor-market-capitalization-af-market-cap) market cap as well as the sale volume. You can easily change the time frame using the tabs on the top right. Simply use the slider module underneath the chart for more precise refinement in the time frame.
