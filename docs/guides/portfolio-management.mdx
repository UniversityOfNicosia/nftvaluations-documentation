# Portfolio Management

## Connect Your Wallet

You can connect your wallet, either with MetaMask or with WalletConnect, by clicking on the <Highlight color="#621df5">**Connect Wallet**</Highlight> button that is found in the top right corner. Whenever you want to connect, you will be asked to sign a message to verify you have access to that wallet.
:::note
Your primary wallet is the one that you used to authenticate into NFTValuations. If you wish to change your primary wallet, sign out and then sign in again using the wallet that you want as your primary.

## Wallet Groups

You can create a Wallet Group where you can add your primary wallet and also [link additional wallets](#link-additional-wallets) in each group. You can [view each wallet group](#portfolio-evaluation) with all the NFTs from the linked wallets in your profile page.

To create a new Wallet Group, you navigate to your profile settings page, click on the <Highlight color="#621df5">**New Group**</Highlight> button, enter a name for the group, and click <Highlight color="#621df5">**Create**</Highlight>.

You can edit and delete any Wallet Groups that you have created by clicking on the <Highlight color="#343a40">**Edit Group**</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#be3d2c">**Delete Group**</Highlight> buttons respectively.
